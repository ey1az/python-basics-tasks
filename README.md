# Python Basics Tasks

This repository contains five Python scripts, each implementing a different task focused on user interaction, data validation, and function-based structure. Below is a summary of each task.

```python
# Task 1: Interactive Statistics Calculator
# - Accepts user input of numbers until 'exit' is typed.
# - Allows multiple numbers per line, separated by spaces.
# - Ignores invalid entries and reports them.
# - On exit, prints count, average, max, min, and median.

# Task 2: Even and Odd Counter
# - Prompts user for how many integers to enter.
# - Accepts one integer at a time; rejects invalid input.
# - Separates and lists even and odd numbers.
# - Displays count and values of even/odd groups.

# Task 3: Personal Income/Expense Tracker
# - Manages a user's income and expenses using a class.
# - Supports adding incomes and expenses with descriptions.
# - Calculates and displays total income, expenses, and balance.

# Task 4: Mirrored String Checker
# - Determines if a string is "mirrored":
#   Even-length → first half == reversed second half
#   Odd-length  → middle character ignored in comparison
# - Repeats until user enters 'exit'.

# Task 5: Full Name Formatter
# - Processes a list of full names from input.
# - Preserves prefixes/suffixes.
# - Converts middle names to initials (e.g., "John Michael Doe" → "John M. Doe").
```

Each task is modularized using functions for clarity and reusability. Error handling and user-friendly prompts are implemented throughout.
